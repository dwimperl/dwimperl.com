=title DWIM Perl - the Perl distribution that contains everything you'll ever need
=subtitle Do What I Mean, Perl

<p>
No new version of <b>DWIM Perl</b> has been released for quite some time. You are probably better off 
using <a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> to install it on Linux
or <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl for Windows</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>DWIM Perl</b> is a Perl distribution that makes it easy to start using Perl.
It contains the standard Perl distribution and a lot of extensions so you won't need to search for them
and install them yourself.
</p>
<p>
DWIM Perl has a <a href="/windows.html">version for Microsoft Windows</a> that
contains Padre, the Perl IDE and all the CPAN modules you'll ever need.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="/linux.html">Linux version</a> was designed to be used primarily on servers. Thus it does not
contain the IDE, but it contains all the CPAN modules you'll need.
